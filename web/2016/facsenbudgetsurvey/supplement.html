			<h1>Supporting Information</h1>
			<h2>Budget Situation (Questions 1-4)</h2>
			<div class="section" id="q1">
				<strong>Q1</strong> If tuition increases are realized, should an agreed upon share of the additional tuition dollars be directed to the units (colleges, departments, programs) that have contributed to these improvements? Tuition increases may be tied to improvements in retention and to increasing numbers of graduates as well as to four- and six-year graduation rates.
			</div>
			<h2>Cost Containment (Questions 5-10)</h2>
			<div class="section" id="q10">
				<strong>Q10</strong> For example, at the Health Science Center there is a mandate to follow the medical workforce during their career. Another example is at the College of Education, which has a mandate to follow the graduates and the achievement of any students that is being taught. Consider examining whether UNM could engage with the New Mexico legislature to re-evaluate these mandates. 
			</div>
			<h2>Education (Questions 11-15)</h2>
			<div class="section" id="q11">
				<p><strong>Q11</strong>A possible example of mentoring and advising of undergraduate students is a systematic program in the History Department to develop graduate student interest in a broad range of careers beyond academic posts, which is furnished by the American Historical Association. Some of the implementation may be accomplished through the Mellon Foundation, which is already deeply involved in some of our departments. Existing, working program may be expanded to embrace a younger group of students. Mentoring may be joined with a workshop approach to build confidence among students in skills associated with high achievement in their major course of study. Satisfaction, retention, and graduation of students may be increased by offering credit or student employment for peer-mentoring services. </p>
				<p>This could include efforts to reduce inefficiencies in course selection to improve graduation rates. </p>
				<p>This may involve reaching out to the local business community, other universities, and industries nationwide, to help graduates find successful employment after graduation and by their success attract more students to UNM. Another possibility would be to deploy student assignments that are immediately applicable to their planned fields and require work in these environments to meet. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="q12">
				<strong>Q12</strong> Senior faculty member who have an interest in student mentorship may be provided with an opportunity to focus their efforts on providing mentorship to graduate students to enhance the graduate student's training and their ability to teach introductory level courses. 
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="q13">
				<strong>Q13</strong> Possible scenarios may include the integration of junior faculty members into a senior faculty member's laboratory or division to gather experience with advanced administrative functions (e.g. compliance, keeping multiple IRB protocols current, submission and management of multi-center grants).
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="q14">
				<strong>Q14</strong> An initial focus may be to invite alumni and former students who are originally from South America, which has traditionally been a major target region for the recruitment of students. 
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="q15">
				<strong>Q15</strong> Faculty members' efforts to develop student-success initiatives may include enhancement of the quality and effectiveness of mentoring services provided by faculty and staff. Mechanisms to reward faculty members may include academic support, career development, psychosocial support, mentorship, professional skills development, and sponsorship learning outcomes. 
			</div>
			<h2>Productivity (Questions 16-23)</h2>
			<div class="section" id="q16">
				<strong>Q16</strong> This process may help to further develop quantitative financial, non-financial, academic, research and administrative metrics, such as class size, student retention, course completion rates, student FTEs, degrees awarded, cost/student, cost/FTE, cost/student credit hr., etc., to evaluate productivity. 
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="q17">
				<strong>Q17</strong> This analysis may include metrics, such as student satisfaction, the number of graduates (by degree) in the last five years, the number of teaching hours (Student credit hours), the number of courses taught by tenure-line faculty, and the number of students per course. 
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="q18">
				<strong>Q18</strong> It has come to our attention that some classrooms on campus are so old that they are almost impossible to teach from, lacking Wi-Fi and decent acoustics. Older buildings are often inefficient with air and dust entering through poorly maintained windows. More space for student study and renovation of the classrooms or student instructional areas or equipment may also be needed. Utility costs for the university entail $40 million. Small adjustments focusing on building efficiency (e.g., maintenance of windows, building temperature changes) may result in decreased utility costs. 
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="q20">
				<strong>Q20</strong> The need to cover inflation for collections is analogous to utility increases. If collections' budgets do not keep pace, we slowly lose buying power and collection strength, which in turn undermines our ability to sustain support in key areas and reduces our ability to support new research areas and programs. The libraries have over three million volumes. Space to properly house print collections may be critical and off-site storage for lesser used materials may be required. More space for student study may also be needed, which off-site storage for materials will support.  
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="q22">
				<strong>Q22</strong> For example, a FS compliance advisory committee might be established to advise whether the reduction of the number of policies and enhancing consultation services to the faculty to interpret policies may improve compliance and reduce faculty burden of compliance related resource allocation. A compliance committee under the auspices of the faculty senate may be considered to promote and provide consultation on compliance related activities to the faculty.
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="q23">
				<strong>Q23</strong> IT technologies (e.g., online learning, ITV) may be reviewed to determine whether they meet needs in rural areas and ensure curriculum fidelity and rigor.
			</div>
			<h2>Growth Strategies (Questions 24-26)</h2>
			<div class="section" id="q24">
				<strong>Q24</strong> A strategic plan for growth and use of resources may involve a four to five year plan of strategies that integrates the ups and downs of the budget, yet staying focused on a growth plan for UNM. Should a vision of the growth of UNM over the coming years be articulated that includes attracting an increasing number of students from surrounding states? 
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="q26">
				<strong>Q26</strong> For example, the implementation of term limits (e.g. 10 years) for top-level administrators, such as department chairs, may foster new visions and efficiencies. Reconsider the UNM graduate hiring policy. Should UNM stop hiring UNM graduates into faculty positions without substantive time outside the institution following graduation? 
			</div>
			<h2>Risk Management (Question 27)</h2>
			<div class="section" id="q27">
				<strong>Q27</strong> Simplifying or summarizing compliance policies and processes in plain language may result in better compliance, thus minimizing the risk and legal costs due to non-compliance. Consider establishing a compliance committee under the auspices of the faculty senate that provides consultation on compliance related activities to the faculty.
			</div>
			<h2>Support and Revenue Basis (Question 28)</h2>
			<div class="section" id="q28">
				<strong>Q28</strong> Possible examples include: Consider supporting the STC and the CTSC to expand the Angel's Investors initiative. Consider enhancing targeted industry-oriented training and technology development programs be enhanced. Consider “Incubators or Innovation Centers” – programs to enhance industry partnerships. Consider embedding businesses across the entire university, similar to an existing HSC CTSC Biodesign program that is modeled after a program at Stanford University, and engage business and engineering schools in creating new products and services that will benefit the student's learning experience and success. Consider engaging national and international corporations to employ the highly skilled workforce thus created in New Mexico.
